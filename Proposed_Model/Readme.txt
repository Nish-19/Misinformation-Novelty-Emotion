Final_BD.ipynb and Final_FNC.ipynb are the python notebook where the final fake-news classification for BD and FNC are done.

The other files include the predictions and the represenations of the novelty and emotion models that are generated as specified in the paper. 

All the generated representations along with their prediction files have to be placed in the ByteDance_Data, FNC_Data and CS_Data folders respectively for running the code. 

Due to size constraints while uploading the code, we are not able to provide the represenations and predictions. Hence, one has to generate it using the novelty and emotion models as described in the main readme.
